# Anime Meme Generator | Clean Architecture | Clean Code | Design Patterns

Simple Anime Meme Generator With Power Concepts Underneath.

Practice:

- Clean architecture

- Clean D.R.Y code

- Service locator design pattern

- Observer design pattern

- RestFUL API resource identification, representation, and presentation

- Separation of concerns (Decoupling / Do One Thing)

- Theming your entire app with ThemeData

- Working with a ToastService API (persisting temporary content for users to see)
  
Why Clean Architecture?

- Because we like to create ALOT of folders :D

- you can design applications with very low coupling (different folders) independent of technical implementation details.

- the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change.

- Clean architecture allows us to create architectural boundaries between dependencies (have a bunch of folders) which allows components to be intrinsically testable

Tools/Libraries (Packages)

- get_it: a service locator (also a runtime dependency injector)

- Provider: a flutter state management (You can use any kind of state management you prefer)
