Practice clean architecture, clean code and service locator design pattern

By employing clean architecture, you can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation details. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change. Clean architecture allows us to create architectural boundaries between dependencies which allows components to be intrinsically testable

Tools/Libraries (Packages)

- get_it: a service locator (also a runtime dependency injector)

- Provider: a flutter state management (You can use any kind of state management you prefer)
